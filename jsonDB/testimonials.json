I’ve only made it to one hackathon but it was great experience - meeting other people at the same stage in their nascent coding careers was super helpful, I’m really going to make the effort to get out to more of those. Plus the Bootcampers Collective slack group is a great resource for finding answers to technical questions, helping out other recent grads and just enjoying general camaraderie.  Keep up the good work! You guys are building something something really powerful that’s going to help a ton of people.",

I consider myself a proud member of the group ever since I came to the first meet up at the Boulder Beer Brewing Company. Everyone there including you, Charlie, makes me feel welcome and showed how willing you are to help others achieve greatness. I always look forward to the meetups and regret when I can’t make it to one.",
